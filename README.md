# Python-Messenger
Send messenges on the terminal with Python

# Why, How?
I am starting this side project to help take my mind off of school exams and learn more in depth about security and networking.

I plan to create my own methods and to not use any external libraries as a challenge for myself, else this would be way to simple, this also forces myself to truely understand what happens in the background between the server and the clients.

As of now, the server stores all users in a array, the users carry keys for encrypting and decrypting messages, which are randomly generated by the sender and is set for the receiver, the only problem is that the server knows the keys, this is planned to be completly private, but this is a future feature.
